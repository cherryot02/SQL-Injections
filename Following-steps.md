## SQL Injections
I learned a little bit of creating databases with Microsoft Access and Excel in one of my first few classes for an Associates degree. <br />
Only tiny bit of that we learn how to use SQL queries where you basically do some  <br />
```
SELECT * 
WHERE name.whatever
```

Stuff like that.<br />

With SQL injections, we are basically doing the same thing except we have those in the input section where you would usually type in some information. <br />

Most databases will most likely have some type of relational tables labeled with some possible PII, which is the most likely the target of a cyber criminal who will exploit that. <br />

With my little knowledge, I do know that the SQL injections may not work for every databases unless they are using SQL, and with most modern companies, <br />
I am pretty sure they have a more secured environment and good code for attack like these to not happen. <br />

With that being said, this is a lab on how to do SQL injections, for educational purposes only.<br />
