# First Injection and Exploring

To start, the lab's first step is to analyze what happens if you tried an injection like this.
```
http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1
```
So before I did the injection, I looked over what information is publicly out in the site just so I can tell any differences after injecting. <br />

So then first tried the commands on the second link from my resources.<br />
I added a â€˜ <br />

Result:

Then I did: 
```
ORDER BY 1.
```
I did notice that the space in the URL translates to %20 but the site just went back to normal. <br />

removing the space result to an error again.<br />
